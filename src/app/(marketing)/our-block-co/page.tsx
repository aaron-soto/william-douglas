      <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-3">
        Our Block Co was founded by William Douglas, inspired by the mid-century modern architecture of Phoenix, AZ. The iconic breeze blocks, known for their ability to play with light and add texture and pattern to architectural designs, captivated Williamâ€™s imagination.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-3">
        Determined to elevate the classic designs, William introduced a third dimension to the blocks, creating dynamic pieces that honor mid-century aesthetics while offering a bold, modern twist. These innovative blocks captured the spirit of the past with a fresh, eye-catching approach.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-3">
        The research and development of these unique designs were made possible through the support of two business partners who initially funded the project. Although William has since been bought out, the legacy of his designs lives on.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-3">
        Each block and tile is still handmade, one at a time, in Phoenix, AZ. These pieces remain available for purchase, providing a blend of craftsmanship and architectural history.
